/* String is not a primitive data type in Java
// what are the three types of castig in Java
// large to small = explicit
// small to large = implicit
if we have a string and we are required to change it to integer, Double etc .. we have to use non-primitive data types
There are 3 variables in java 1 local-declared and initialized inside a method 2 instance and 3 static
